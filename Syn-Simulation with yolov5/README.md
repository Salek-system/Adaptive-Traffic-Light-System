# Traffic Simulator

## About The Project

A traffic simulator implemented in Python using pygame.
We learned more about how the project was created through this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/simulating-traffic-flow-in-python-ee1eab4dd20f).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires `numpy`, `pygame`, and `scipy`, and works with Python 3.

### Using trafficSimulator in folder [traffic Simulator project]

Simply put the `trafficSimulator` folder in the same path as your file, Then use `from trafficSimulator import *`.

# File structure: 
- [yolo5v](yolov5) In this folder, all the files are needed for the emergency module, for the ability to detect.
- [trafficSimulatorproject](traffic Simulator project) In this folder, all files required to run the traffic simulation environment in the synchronization module.

## Documentation

Therefore, all folders in this part include synchronization and emergency module, which means that uploading the files here means the project integration together.
